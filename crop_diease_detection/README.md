Project Overview
This project uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify crop diseases based on images of leaves. The model is trained on a dataset of healthy and diseased crop images, and it can predict the type of disease affecting the plant.

Features
Image Classification: Detects diseases in crop images.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for farmers and researchers.

Scalable: Can be extended to support more crops and diseases.

Open Source: Free to use and modify.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/Saronzeleke/crop_disease_detection.git  
cd crop_disease_detection  
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Download the dataset (see Dataset section for details).

Run the application:

bash
Copy
python app.py  
Usage
Launch the application.

Upload an image of a crop leaf.

The model will predict whether the crop is healthy or affected by a disease.

View the results and recommended actions.

Dataset
The model is trained on the PlantVillage Dataset, which contains images of healthy and diseased crops. The dataset includes the following crops:

Tomato

Potato

Corn

... (add more crops if applicable)

To download the dataset, visit the PlantVillage website or use the provided script:

bash
Copy
python download_dataset.py  
Model Architecture
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The architecture includes:

Input layer: 224x224 RGB images

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation

Max-pooling layers

Fully connected layers

Output layer with softmax activation

The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
